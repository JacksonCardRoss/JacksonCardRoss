<h1 align="center">Hey there, I'm Jackson 👋</h1>

<b1 align="left">I am a Backend Software Developer with experience using Java, AWS, and Cloud-native technology tools.
Recently, I have contributed to hands-on dynamic application build projects and look forward to further collaboration with architects, engineers, QA, and Operations teams to design and develop  highly scalable, database-driven consumer web applications.

I always loved coding and I took every coding class that was available to me in high school. Likewise, during my senior year, I simultaneously enrolled at Jordan Career and Technical Education (CTE) for their Java-focused Web Development Course. After I graduated high school, I enrolled at Bloomtech to get more hands-on experience and verified credentials.

👀Feel free to check out my recent project highlights below or connect with me to learn more! 💬</b1>
